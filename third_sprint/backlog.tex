\section{Sprint Backlogs}\label{sec:backlog}

In Figures~\ref{fig:sprint_1}~-~\ref{fig:sprint_4}, the issue backlog can
be found. The list for each sprint consists of the issues that were planned
for that particular sprint. A green background implies that the issue was
actually addressed, a red background implies that it had to be postponed to
a later sprint.
