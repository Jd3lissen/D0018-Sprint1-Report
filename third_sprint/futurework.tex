\subsection{Future Work} 

As seen in the Appendix~\ref{sec:backlog} there are several issues that
we did not adhere to in the third (last) sprint. For future developement these
should presumably be implemented for an enhaced user experience. To update
the About page is not a too complicated endeavour but was still ignored since
this project is more of a proof of concept than a fully deployed webshop,
therefore ethics and information of this site was not added.

The three last issues \textit{Add HTTPS, Payments, and E-mail Reciept}, would
be be critical for completing the last chapter of this webshop. Although these
implementations would require additional thought regarding managing tables
and the DBMS, the technologies are rather outside of the scope of this course.

Django does have implementation guides for including HTTPS to the Django-App,
although there may be more to attend to througout this project to make it
possible. Adding an automated email service is also somthing that could be
implemented via the Django-framework.  Payment systems on the other hand
would require a dive into a completely new technology-field. Given that this
is not the objective of this course, the chances of this being implemented
are slim but would nethertheless, would be interesting and fun functionality
to implement.
