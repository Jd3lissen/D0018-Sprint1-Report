\subsection{Future Work} 

As seen in the appendix there are several issues that we did not adhere to in the third (last) sprint. For future developement these should presumably be implemented for an enhaced user experience. To update the About page is not a too complicated endeavour but was still ignored since this project is more of a proof on concept than a fully deployed webshop. The three last issues \textit{App HTTPS, Payments, and E-mail Reciept}, would be be critical for completing the last chapter of this webshop. Although these implementation would require additional thought regarding managing tables and the DBMS, the technologies are rather outside of the scope of this course.Django does have implementation guides for including HTTPS to the django-App, although there may be more to attent to througout this project to make it possible. Adding an automated email service is also somthing that could be implemented via Django. Payment systems on the other hand would require a dive into a completely new area. Given this is not the objective of this course the chances that this is implemented are slim but would nethertheless an interesting and fun functionality to implement.
