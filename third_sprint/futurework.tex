\subsection{Future Work} 

\subsubsection{About Page}\label{sec:about}

As seen in Appendix~\ref{sec:backlog} there are several issues that were
not yet resolved. For future development these should be implemented for
an enhanced user experience. To update the About page was ignored since
this project is more of a proof of concept than a fully deployed web shop, but
should be implemented before actually starting a business to build trust with
users.

\subsubsection{Proper Order Handling}\label{sec:security}

The three last issues \textit{Add HTTPS, Payments, and E-mail Receipt}, would
be be critical for completing the last chapter of this web shop. Although these
implementations would require additional thought regarding managing tables
and the DBMS, the technologies are rather outside of the scope of this course.

Django has implementation guides for including HTTPS to the Django-App,
so that part should be rather easily implemented. Adding an automated email
service is also something that could be implemented via the Django-framework.
Payment systems on the other hand would require a dive into a completely
new technology-field. Given that this is not the objective of this course,
the chances of this being implemented are slim, it would nevertheless be
interesting and fun to implement such functionality.
