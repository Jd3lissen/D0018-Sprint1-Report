\begin{itemize}
  \item[\textbf{Users:}] Contains the Users, both admins and non-admins. The
    email is used to identify the User at login, so no username is needed.
  \item[\textbf{Orders:}] Used to represent the shopping basket before an
    Order was made (\mintinline{python}{payment == False}), an Order that has
    been paid but not yet processed and shipped (\mintinline{python}{payment
    == True and status == False}), as well as finished Orders
    (\mintinline{python}{status == True}). Each Order has one User.
  \item[\textbf{OrderItems:}] The mapping between Orders and Products
    (Products were previously known as Items, that is why the name is still
    OrderItems, may be subject to change in a later release). Keeps track
    of how many of each product is included in the Order, as well as the
    price of the Product at the time it was paid.
  \item[\textbf{ProductType:}] The different possible types of a product. With
    each ProductType there is an associated unit in which a given amount
    of that ProductType is measured. These can be used when searching for
    products.
  \item[\textbf{Product:}] The merchandise, including name, availability,
  price, image and ProductType. Price and availability are used for sorting.
  \item[\textbf{Review:}] A review by a User on a Product, containing a rating
    and an optional comment. Only one review per product is allowed, if the
    same user tries to add another review, it overwrites the previous one. The
    rating is used for sorting.
