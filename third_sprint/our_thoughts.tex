\subsection{Our Thoughts}

Here are a couple of explanations as to why we've implemented some of the features the way we have.

\subsubsection{Handling Orders}

When a user pays for an order he can no longer remove the order. The admin on the other hand can remove an order after it's been paid (assuming the company sends money back to the customer) but not after the order has been handled. He can also set the handled status of orders, both to handled and to not handled in case there is a problem or misunderstanding.

\subsubsection{Availability}

\subsubsection{Filtering}

When you filter the products after availability the products sorts from most available to least. It also removes the products that are not available at the moment.
