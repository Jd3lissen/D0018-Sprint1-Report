Databases are a fundamental part of the way we perceive the web. In order
to practice using one, an E-Commerce website was built. It was decided to
sell berries and related goods.

The technology stack was based on Django on top of a PostgreSQL database. Due
to the problem constraint, the database schema was developed independently, and
then added to Django using its \mintinline{python}{inspectdb} command.

The service allowed for creating an account, adding items to a basket and
checking out that basket. It featured sorting and search, as well as product
review. It also provided tools for administrators, such as adding, removing
and editing products and orders.

Though this exercise is a good way of learning to work with a database,
it would be highly recommended to use the Django Object-Relational Mapping
tool in a real-world scenario.\\ \\
