\subsection{Considerations}

Here are a couple of explanations as to why we've implemented some of the
features the way we have.

\subsubsection{Handling Orders}

When a user pays for an order, he can no longer remove the order. The admin
on the other hand can remove an order after it's been paid (assuming the
company sends money back to the customer). This can not be done after the
order has been handled. He can also set the handled status of orders, both
to handled and to not handled in case there is a problem or misunderstanding.

\subsubsection{Availability}

Products can not be added to orders in higher quantity than their availability.
Each time the user interacts with the order basket, the price and the
availability of the products are updated. In the case that the availability
of a product is now lower than the amount of that same product in a users
basket, the whole amount of that product is removed from the basket, to
prevent confusion.

\subsubsection{Filtering}

Products can be filtered according to availability, rating,
and price. This can be done \mintinline{text}{highest-lowest} and
\mintinline{text}{lowest-highest}. When sorting for rating, products with no
reviews are excluded, the same holds true for products without availability
when sorting according to that metric.
