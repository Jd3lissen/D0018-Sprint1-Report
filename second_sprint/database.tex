    the shopping basket before an order was made 
    (\mintinline{python}{payment == False}) an order that has been paid but not 
    yet processed and shipped 
    (\mintinline{python}{payment == True and status == False}), as well as
    finished orders (\mintinline{python}{status == True}). Each order has
    one user.

    idOrders and idProduct to the tables Orders and Product.  Keeps the
