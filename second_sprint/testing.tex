\subsection{Test-cases}

Support for tests was added in the following steps. A test container
was added to docker. When that container runs, it performs all the tests
using pytest~\cite{pytest}. Code coverage analysis is then reported using
coverage.py~\cite{coverage}.

Support for Selenium~\cite{selenium} was also added, in order to support
end-to-end testing. Selenium relies on the browsers Firefox/Google Chrome, and
so far attempts to make those run in docker have been unsuccessful. There are
hopes, however, that such support will be able to be implemented before long.

Thus, though no actual test cases have been written, the groundwork was laid
for being able to perform automated tests.
